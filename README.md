# Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Images-using-Steganography
This project provides a secure and user-friendly way to encrypt and decrypt messages within images using steganography and password protection. The message is embedded inside an image using OpenCV and can only be retrieved with the correct password.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python – Programming language
OpenCV – Image processing
🔥 Features
✔ Steganography-based encryption – Hides messages within image pixels.
✔ Password-protected decryption – Ensures secure message retrieval.
✔ Potential Applications: The concept has applications in fields like security and data protection.
✔ Simplicity: The simple yet effective method of encoding and decoding.
